### **Description of Dataset**

This analysis leverages the publicly available **Kaggle Superstore dataset**, a comprehensive collection of **over 10,000 sales transactions** from a global retailer. The analysis focused on key variables including sales, profit, quantity, discount, and various categorical dimensions like region, product, and customer segments.

### **Key Insights & Observations**
* **Varied Profitability:** The dashboard revealed significant differences in profitability across regions, product categories, and customer segments, highlighting areas for strategic focus.
* **Customer & Product Performance Insights:** They provide a granular view of performance, identifying the **Top 5 customers by sales** and the **Bottom 5 by profit margin** to inform relationship management. The product view identifies the **Top 5 performing products by sales** and **Bottom 5 by profit margin**, supporting strategic product mix and pricing decisions.
* **Key Drivers of Profit Change:** The analysis pinpointed the most influential factors impacting profitability, revealing how specific product categories and discounts drove significant changes in profit margins.

### **Technical Process & Deliverables**
I designed and built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with a suite of tailored tabs to serve as a business intelligence tool for various stakeholders.
* **User-Centric Tabs:** The dashboard provides a single source of truth for different stakeholders, allowing regional managers to track performance and product managers to optimize their portfolios.
* **Advanced Functionalities:** I implemented advanced features to enable deeper analysis, including **drill-through capabilities** from a map to detailed state sales, a **profit waterfall chart** for year-over-year analysis, and a **Key Influencers visual** to identify key drivers of profit changes.
* **Integrated Models:** The **Key Influencers visual** was coupled with a **decision tree model** to provide comprehensive insights into profit drivers.
* **Core Metrics:** The dashboard provides real-time tracking of YTD Sales, YTD Profit, and YTD Profit %, allowing stakeholders to monitor performance at a glance.
